         During the first part of your life, you only become aware of happiness once you have
         lost it. Then an age comes, a second one, in which you already know, at the moment
         when you begin to experience true happiness, that you are, at the end of the day,
        going to lose it. When I met Belle, I understood that I had just entered this second 
        age. I also understood that I hadnâ€™t reached the third age, in which anticipation of the 
         loss of happiness prevents you from living.
